Design CICD pipeline with github, Cloud build, Cloud run and container registry.
 execute.
Building the Docker Image: Cloud Build uses the Dockerfile in your repository to build a container image of your application.
Running Tests: You can include steps to run unit tests, integration tests, or any other automated tests on your code and application.
Storing the Image: Once the Docker image is successfully built, Cloud Build pushes it to Artifact Registry.
3. Container Registry (Artifact Registry)

Secure Storage: Artifact Registry serves as a secure, private repository for your Docker images. It's fully integrated with Google Cloud IAM for access control.
Version Control: Each time a new image is pushed, Artifact Registry stores it with a unique tag (e.g., based on the commit SHA or a version number), providing version control for your container images. This allows for easy rollbacks if needed.
4. Continuous Deployment (CD) with Cloud Build and Cloud Run

Deployment Trigger: After the Docker image is pushed to Artifact Registry, Cloud Build can be configured to continue the pipeline to deploy the application. This can be part of the same cloudbuild.yaml file or a separate trigger.
Deploying to Cloud Run: Cloud Run is a fully managed serverless platform that allows you to deploy containerized applications.
Cloud Build uses the gcloud run deploy command (or equivalent steps in your cloudbuild.yaml ) to deploy the newly built and stored Docker image to a Cloud Run service.
Cloud Run automatically handles scaling, load balancing, and infrastructure management.
You can define various Cloud Run configurations, such as environment variables, memory limits, and concurrency settings, as part of your deployment step.
Overall Workflow:

A developer pushes code changes to a GitHub repository.
The push event triggers a Cloud Build pipeline.
Cloud Build fetches the code, builds the Docker image, and runs tests.
If tests pass, the Docker image is pushed to Artifact Registry.
Cloud Build then deploys the image from Artifact Registry to a Cloud Run service.
The new version of the application is now live on Cloud Run.
This pipeline ensures that every code change is automatically built, tested, and deployed, accelerating your development cycle and reducing manual errors.

**generate python codes for a simple webapp using python and flask framework with hello world sample app**

# app.py

from flask import Flask

# Create a Flask application instance
app = Flask(__name__)

# Define a route for the home page ('/')
@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    """
    This function will be executed when a user navigates to the root URL.
    It returns a simple "Hello, World!" message.
    """
    return 'Hello, World from Flask!'

# This block ensures the application runs only when the script is executed directly
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Run the Flask application in debug mode
    # debug=True allows for automatic reloading on code changes
    # and provides a debugger for development.
    app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=8080)

Explanation of the Code:

from flask import Flask : This line imports the Flask class from the flask package, which is the core of our web application framework.
app = Flask(__name__) : This creates an instance of the Flask class. __name__ is a special Python variable that holds the name of the current module. Flask uses it to determine the root path for resources like templates and static files.
@app.route('/') : This is a decorator provided by Flask. It associates the hello_world() function directly below it with the URL path / (the root URL of your application). When a user visits this URL, the hello_world() function will be executed.
def hello_world(): : This is the Python function that gets called when the / route is accessed.
return 'Hello, World from Flask!' : This line returns the string "Hello, World from Flask!". Flask automatically sends this string as the response to the user's web browser.
if __name__ == '__main__': : This standard Python construct ensures that the code inside this block only runs when the script is executed directly (e.g., python app.py ) and not when it's imported as a module into another script.
app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=8080) :
app.run() starts the Flask development server.
debug=True : This enables debug mode. In debug mode, the server will automatically reload when you make code changes, and it will provide a debugger in case of errors. Important: Never use debug=True in a production environment.
host='0.0.0.0' : This makes the server accessible from any IP address. When deploying to environments like Cloud Run, it's crucial to bind to 0.0.0.0 so the container can receive external requests.
port=8080 : This specifies the port on which the server will listen for incoming connections. Cloud Run services typically expect applications to listen on the port specified by the PORT environment variable (which defaults to 8080 if not set, or you can retrieve it from os.environ.get('PORT', '8080') ).

To run this application locally:

Install Flask: If you don't have it installed, open your terminal or command prompt and run:
pip install Flask

**Save the code: Save the code above into a file named app.py (or any other .py file).**
**Run the application: Navigate to the directory where you saved app.py in your terminal and run:**

python app.py

Access the app: Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8080 or http://localhost:8080 . You should see "Hello, World from Flask!" displayed.

This simple Flask application provides the core functionality for a web server, which you can then containerize and deploy to services like Cloud Run.

ntegrating unit testing into your Python Flask application is a crucial step for ensuring code quality and catching regressions early. For Flask applications, you typically use a testing framework like pytest along with Flask's built-in testing client.

Here's how you can integrate unit testing for the "Hello, World!" Flask app:

1. Install Testing Dependencies

First, you'll need to install pytest and pytest-flask (or just pytest if you want to use Flask's test client directly, but pytest-flask provides convenient fixtures).

pip install pytest pytest-flask

2. Create a Test File

It's common practice to put your tests in a separate directory (e.g., tests/ ) or a separate file. Let's create a file named test_app.py in the same directory as your app.py .

2. Create a Test File

It's common practice to put your tests in a separate directory (e.g., tests/ ) or a separate file. Let's create a file named test_app.py in the same directory as your app.py .

# test_app.py

import pytest
from app import app # Import the Flask app instance from your app.py

@pytest.fixture
def client():
    """
    This fixture provides a test client for your Flask application.
    It sets up the app for testing by disabling debug mode and handling context.
    """
    app.config['TESTING'] = True # Enable testing mode
    with app.test_client() as client:
        yield client # Yield the client to the test functions

def test_hello_world(client):
    """
    Tests that the home page ('/') returns the correct 'Hello, World!' message
    and a 200 OK status code.
    """
    response = client.get('/') # Make a GET request to the root URL
    assert response.status_code == 200 # Check if the status code is 200 OK
    assert b'Hello, World from Flask!' in response.data # Check if the response data contains the expected message
Explanation of the Test Code:

import pytest : Imports the pytest testing framework.
from app import app : Imports the app Flask instance from your app.py file. This is crucial because your tests need to interact with your actual Flask application.
@pytest.fixture : This decorator defines a Pytest fixture. Fixtures are functions that are run before test functions to provide setup (e.g., creating a test client) and cleanup.
client() fixture : This fixture configures your Flask app for testing:
app.config['TESTING'] = True : Sets Flask's TESTING configuration to True . This disables error catching during request handling, allowing exceptions to propagate to your tests, and also enables some other testing-specific behaviors.
with app.test_client() as client: : This is the core of Flask testing. app.test_client() creates a test client that allows you to simulate requests to your application without actually running a server. The with statement ensures the client context is properly handled.
yield client : The yield keyword makes this a yield fixture. Code before yield runs as setup, and code after yield (if any) runs as teardown. Here, it yields the configured test client to any test function that requests it.
def test_hello_world(client): : This defines our actual test function. Pytest automatically discovers functions starting with test_ .
client : Pytest automatically injects the client fixture defined above into this test function because its name matches the fixture name.
response = client.get('/') : This uses the test client to simulate a GET request to the root URL ( / ) of your Flask application.
assert response.status_code == 200 : This assertion checks if the HTTP status code returned by the simulated request is 200 (OK).
assert b'Hello, World from Flask!' in response.data : This assertion checks if the response data (which is in bytes) contains the expected "Hello, World from Flask!" string. The b prefix denotes a byte string.
3. Run the Tests

Navigate to the directory containing your app.py and test_app.py in your terminal and run pytest :

pytest

Expected Output:

If everything is set up correctly, you should see output similar to this, indicating that your test passed:

============================= test session starts ==============================

Integrating with Your CI/CD Pipeline (Cloud Build)

When you define your cloudbuild.yaml for your CI/CD pipeline, you'll add a step to run these tests before building the Docker image or deploying the application. This ensures that only code that passes all unit tests proceeds through the pipeline.

# cloudbuild.yaml (excerpt for testing step)

steps:
- name: 'python:3.9-slim' # Use a Python image for running tests
  entrypoint: 'bash'
  args:
    - '-c'
    - |
      pip install Flask pytest pytest-flask
      pytest # Run your tests
  id: 'Run Unit Tests'

# ... subsequent steps for building Docker image and deploying

By placing the test step early in your cloudbuild.yaml , you create a "fail-fast" mechanism: if tests fail, the build stops immediately, preventing a broken image from being built or deployed.
python -m pytest tests

### Generate Cloud build yaml file
# cloudbuild.yaml

steps:
  # 1. Run Unit Tests
  - name: 'python:3.9-slim'
    entrypoint: 'bash'
    args:
      - '-c'
      - |
        pip install Flask pytest pytest-flask
        pytest
    id: 'Run Unit Tests'

  # 2. Build the Docker Image
  - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
    args:
      - 'build'
      - '-t'
      - 'us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/cs-poc-lhsovao7bcucdrmgyhgjrvg/cloud-run-source-deploy/flask-app:${SHORT_SHA}'
      - '.'
    id: 'Build Docker Image'

  # 3. Push the Docker Image to Artifact Registry
  - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
    args:
      - 'push'
      - 'us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/cs-poc-lhsovao7bcucdrmgyhgjrvg/cloud-run-source-deploy/flask-app:${SHORT_SHA}'
    id: 'Push Docker Image'

  # 4. Deploy to Cloud Run
  - name: 'gcr.io/google-cloud-sdk'
    entrypoint: gcloud
    args:
      - 'run'
      - 'deploy'
      - 'flask-app'
      - '--image'

      - 'us-central1'
      - '--platform'
      - 'managed'
      - '--allow-unauthenticated'
    id: 'Deploy to Cloud Run'

# Define the Artifact Registry repository

Key points:

steps : This section defines the sequence of operations Cloud Build will perform.
Run Unit Tests : This step installs Flask, pytest, and pytest-flask, then runs the unit tests using pytest . It uses a standard python image.
Build Docker Image : This step uses the docker build command to create a Docker image from your application code and Dockerfile. It tags the image with the commit SHA for versioning.
Push Docker Image : This step pushes the built Docker image to Artifact Registry. Make sure to replace the registry path with your actual Artifact Registry path.
Deploy to Cloud Run : This step uses the gcloud run deploy command to deploy the Docker image to Cloud Run. It specifies the service name, image, region, platform (managed), and allows unauthenticated access (if needed). Replace flask-app with your desired service name and us-central1 with your desired region.
images : This section defines the images that Cloud Build will push to Artifact Registry.
substitutions : This section defines any substitutions that will be used in the build process. In this case, it defines a substitution for the service name.
Important : Replace us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/cs-poc-lhsovao7bcucdrmgyhgjrvg/cloud-run-source-deploy/flask-app with your Artifact Registry path. Also, replace flask-app with your desired Cloud Run service name.
--allow-unauthenticated : This flag makes your Cloud Run service publicly accessible. Remove it if you require authentication.
options: substitution_option: 'ALLOW_LOOSE' : This allows you to define substitutions that may not be used in every build.
